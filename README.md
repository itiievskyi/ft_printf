# ft_printf
The goal of the project is to create a library that could replace Unix 'printf' function.

The standard functions that we allowed to use are: 
* write
* malloc
* free
* exit
* The functions of man 3 stdarg

The **ft_printf** function handles most of the standard flags, including -sS, -cC, -xX, -i, -d, etc., as well as modificators like #, 1, ' ' and others.

### How to use
* Download and compile the library usnig Makefile.
* Connect **libftprintf.a** and **ft_printf.h** header file to your program.
* Use **ft_printf** function like the standard printf.

### Enjoy!
